        Finisterre translates as the “end of the world” and for many pilgrims they feel that 
        their journey is only complete when they can walk no more. Walk through the Galician countryside 
        and medieval villages to finish up at the ocean. It is here that pilgrims would 
        traditionally burn their boots after completing their pilgrimage.

        Is the striking route from the northern coast down to Santiago de Compostella. 
        It was originally the route taken by seafaring pilgrims of Northern Europe. Pilgrims from 
        countries as far away as Scandinavia, England, Scotland and Ireland would have travelled 
        from their homes to ports, and then sailed to the coast of Galicia. 
        From there, their pilgrimage to reach the tomb of St James would begin.
